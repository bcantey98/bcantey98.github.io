                    My career goals for the future consist of becoming one the best music producers in 
                    music industry. Along with becoming the best of the best I want to start my own tech firm
                    and take on government contracts. Also at some point I want to create my own streaming service
                    for music and eventually I want to expand to other types of media entertainment.
