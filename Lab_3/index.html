      <h2>Welcome</h2>

      <p>Welcome to my website that introduces you to a world of only dogs. 
        If this were a real site, it would be the ideal place to come to learn more about different dog breeds, 
        whether you are a beginner looking to learn different breeds, 
        or an expert wanting to share ideas, stories, and photos with other like-minded people.</p>

      <p>So don't waste time! Learn, learn, learn!</p>
